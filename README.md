# potatoRpgSim
Simulates many runs of the Potato single player RPG

## Potato Strategy
If Orcs is at 8 it's possible for orcs to win next turn.

So if Orcs is 8 or higher and you have enough potatoes, use the "Hurling in the back garden" action.

## Results
* GamesRan:1000000 
* DestinyWins:273837 
* PotatoeWins:176276 
* OrcWins:579721

You'll notice those numbers add up to more than 1000000. Several roll results add to multiple scores, meaning you can win the game in different ways at once.

### Disclaimer
I didn't throughly test this so there are probably bugs.
